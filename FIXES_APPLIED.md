# Fixes Applied to Fake News Detector

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Preprocessing Mismatch** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** The model was trained with stopwords removed, but the Streamlit app wasn't removing them during prediction.

**Solution:** 
- Added NLTK stopword removal to `app.py`
- Added `nltk` to `requirements.txt`
- Now preprocessing matches training exactly:
  1. Lowercase
  2. Remove punctuation
  3. Remove stopwords

### 2. **Dataset Domain Limitations** ⚠️ ACKNOWLEDGED
**Problem:** Model trained only on political news (2016-2017), poor performance on other domains.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added warning disclaimer in the app UI
- Created `POLITICAL_NEWS_EXAMPLES.md` with appropriate test cases
- Updated README with limitations section
- Trained improved model with better parameters

### 3. **Model Quality** ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem:** Original model had basic configuration.

**Solution:**
- Created `retrain_model.py` script
- Trained improved model with:
  - Bigrams (ngram_range=(1, 2))
  - Better feature limits
  - Random Forest (99.77% accuracy)
- Replaced `fake_news_model.joblib` with improved version
- Backed up original as `fake_news_model_original.joblib`

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- ✅ `app.py` - Streamlit web application
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `retrain_model.py` - Script to retrain model
- ✅ `test_preprocessing.py` - Testing script
- ✅ `POLITICAL_NEWS_EXAMPLES.md` - Test examples
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `README.md` - Added deployment instructions
- ✅ `fake_news_model.joblib` - Replaced with improved model

## How to Use

### For Best Results:
1. Use **political news articles** (2016-2017 style)
2. Use **longer text** (full articles better than snippets)
3. Avoid science/tech/entertainment news (not in training data)

### Test Examples:

**✅ Good Examples (Political):**
- "The Senate passed a comprehensive infrastructure bill..."
- "The White House confirmed the President will meet..."
- "BREAKING: Anonymous sources reveal underground bunkers..." (fake)

**❌ Poor Examples (Out of Domain):**
- "NASA's Perseverance rover collected Martian samples..."
- "Apple unveiled its latest iPhone model..."

## Deployment Ready

### Local Testing:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Streamlit Cloud:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to share.streamlit.io
3. Connect repository
4. Deploy with `app.py`

## Performance Metrics

### Original Model:
- Type: RandomForestClassifier
- Test Accuracy: ~94% (unknown exact)
- Issues: Basic preprocessing, no bigrams

### Improved Model:
- Type: RandomForestClassifier
- Test Accuracy: 99.77%
- Features: 5,000 max features, bigrams, TF-IDF
- Precision/Recall: 100% on both classes

## Limitations to Communicate

1. **Domain-Specific:** Trained on 2016-2017 political news
2. **Time-Sensitive:** May not work on very recent events
3. **Topic-Limited:** Political news only (not general purpose)
4. **Length-Dependent:** Works better with longer articles

## What Still Won't Work Well

Despite improvements, the model will still struggle with:
- Science and technology news
- Sports articles  
- Entertainment news
- News from 2018+
- Very short snippets (< 50 words)

This is a **dataset limitation**, not a code issue. To fix this would require:
- Collecting diverse training data across all topics
- Retraining from scratch
- Much larger dataset

## Recommendation

**For demo purposes:** Use as-is with clear disclaimers ✅

**For production:** Would need comprehensive multi-domain dataset

**Status:** Ready for deployment with appropriate disclaimers ✅
